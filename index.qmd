👋🏾 Hello, and welcome to my website.

I'm Tamisha, currently a second year biomedical engineering student at Johns Hopkins University. I am a bioinformatician-in-training passionate about data science, social change, and improving patient healthcare outcomes. When I'm not learning or doing research, I love to read, practice hand lettering, and travel the world.
