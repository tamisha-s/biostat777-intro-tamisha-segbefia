As described in the website, this dataset of breast cancer patients was obtained from the 2017 November update of the SEER Program of the NCI, which provides information on population-based cancer statistics.\nThe question I aim to answer is: what can the race of the patient tell us about the other features?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWhile I acknowledge that we would need a deeper analysis, such as perhaps a comparison of genomic data (e.g., BRCA 1/2 status), I thought this would be an interesting way to look at how race and other features are related in this dataset.\n\n\nThis example analysis is intended for people who are starting to work with healthcare data and are interested in seeing how factors such as race affect patient health outcomes.\n\nInstalling packages and loading libraries\n\ninstall.packages(\"ggcorrplot\", repos=\"http://cran.us.r-project.org\")\n\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggcorrplot)\n\n\n\nExploring the dataset to be used\n\nbc &lt;- read_csv(\"data/SEER_Breast_Cancer_Dataset.csv\")\n\n\nbc &lt;- bc %&gt;%\n  rename(age = Age,\n         race = Race,\n         marital_status = \"Marital Status\",\n         t_stage = \"T Stage\",\n         n_stage = \"N Stage\",\n         sixth_stage = \"6th Stage\",\n         grade = \"Grade\",\n         a_stage = \"A Stage\",\n         tumor_size = \"Tumor Size\",\n         estrogen_status = \"Estrogen Status\",\n         progesterone_status = \"Progesterone Status\",\n         regional_node_examined = \"Regional Node Examined\",\n         regional_node_pos = \"Reginol Node Positive\",\n         survival_months = \"Survival Months\",\n         status = Status) %&gt;%\n  mutate_if(is.character, as.factor)\n\n\nData Dictionary\n\nData dictionary for the SEER Breast Cancer Dataset\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nClass\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nage\ndouble\nage at diagnosis\n\n\nrace\nfactor\nrace recode (white, black, other)\n\n\nmarital_status\nfactor\nmarital status at diagnosis\n\n\nt_stage\nfactor\nBreast Adjusted AJCC 6th T (1988+)\n\n\nn_stage\nfactor\nBreast Adjusted AJCC 6th N (1988+)\n\n\nsixth_stage\nfactor\nBreast Adjusted AJCC 6th Stage (1988+)\n\n\ngrade\nfactor\ngrade as defined in ICD-O-2; 1992\n\n\na_stage\nfactor\nSEER historic stage A\n\n\ntumor_size\ndouble\nCS tumor size (2004+)\n\n\nestrogen_status\nfactor\nER Status Recode Breast Cancer (1990+)\n\n\nprogesterone_status\nfactor\nPR Status Recode Breast Cancer (1990+)\n\n\nregional_node_examined\ndouble\ntotal number of regional lymph nodes that were removed and examined by the pathologist\n\n\nregional_node_pos\ndouble\nthe exact number of regional lymph nodes examined by the pathologist that were found to contain metastases\n\n\nsurvival_months\ndouble\nsurvival months\n\n\nstatus\nfactor\nvital status recode (1 = alive, 2 = dead)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilding our plots/visualization\nFirst, I want to see the total number of patients that are either alive or dead by race.\n\nbc_status &lt;- bc %&gt;%\n  mutate(race = recode(race, \"Other (American Indian/AK Native, Asian/Pacific Islander)\" = \"Other (not Black/White)\")) %&gt;%\n  group_by(race, status) %&gt;%\n  summarise(total = n()) %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(fill=status, y=total, x=race)) +\n    geom_bar(position=\"dodge\", stat=\"identity\") +\n    scale_x_discrete(labels=c('Black', 'Other (not Black/White)', 'White')) +\n    labs(\n      title = \"Visualizing status of breast cancer patients in the SEER dataset\",\n      subtitle = \"Comparison between Black, White, and Other (American Indian, Asian/Pacific Islander)\",\n      x = \"Race\",\n      y = \"Number of patients\"\n    )\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'race'.

However, from the data dictionary, this makes sense because regional_node_pos is dependent on regional_node_examined.\nHowever, it seems as though there might be negative correlation between the following:\n\ntumor_size and age\ntumor_size and survival_months\nregional_node_pos and survival_months\n\nLet‚Äôs explore one of those further.\n\n\nVisualizing tumor_size and survival_months, grouped by race\nNow, I want to see if there might be a causal relationship between tumor size and survival months, grouped by race. This relationship was highlighted in (Tanvetyanon et al. 2010).\n\ng &lt;- bc %&gt;%\n  mutate(race = recode(race, \"Other (American Indian/AK Native, Asian/Pacific Islander)\" = \"Other (not Black/White)\")) %&gt;%\n  group_by(race) %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(tumor_size, survival_months)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  facet_grid(rows = vars(race)) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Visualizing tumor size vs survival months\",\n    subtitle = \"Grouped by race to look for differences\",\n    x = \"Tumor size (in millimeters)\",\n    y = \"Survival months\"\n  )\n\ng\n\n\n\n\nThought not very noticeable, the graph above shows the slightly negative linear relationship between survival months and tumor size.\n\n\n\nSummary and Conclusion\nIn conclusion, I started to look at the different features related to female patients with breast cancer. I also began to explore how race could play a part in looking for these differences.\nHonestly, I know there is more I could do for this analysis. I intend to extend this project by creating and running a prediction algorithm to see how well I could predict status (alive/dead) based on the different features.\nThanks for reading!\n\nAppendix\nBelow are the different functions I used from each of the packages.\nFrom dplyr / tidyr:\n\nrename()\nmutate_if()\ngroup_by\nsummarise()\nn()\nselect()\n\nFrom ggplot2:\n\ngeom_bar()\nfacet_grid()\ngeom_point()\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nTanvetyanon, Tawee, Lary Robinson, K.
